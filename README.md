# COVID-19-Dataset-Challenge
This challenge was completed asa course requirement for University of Toronto MIE1624: Intro to Data Science course as a replacement exam where the student had 7 days to complete. I elected to create a recommendation tool that researches can use to find similar articles to the one used as an input to enable faster resource collecting on specific topics.
As the dataset from Kaggle is too large to upload, a link is provided below for looking at the data.
